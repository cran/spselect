Description: Fits spatial scale (SS) forward stepwise regression, SS incremental forward stagewise regression, SS least angle regression (LARS), and SS lasso models.  All area-level covariates are considered at all available scales to enter a model, but the SS algorithms are constrained to select each area-level covariate at a single spatial scale.
